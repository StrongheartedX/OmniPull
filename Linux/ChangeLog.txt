2.0.8
- Updated bundled yt-dlp to nightly: 2025.11.24.232953.dev0
- Fixed startup crash caused by invalid/empty merge_output_format (now validated, defaults to mp4)
- Hardened yt-dlp updater:
    - Downloads to a temp file and safely replaces the exe
    - Updater now returns clear status and messages to the UI
- Settings UI improvements and validation:
    - Debounced and threaded probing of executables to avoid blocking UI on open
    - Inline warnings instead of repeated modal popups
    - Correct handling of 'use custom yt-dlp' checkbox (falls back to bundled if unset)
- Installer / bundled exe detection fixes:
    - Config now re-resolves bundled/executable paths on startup/settings load
- Misc fixes:
    - Fix for slow settings dialog startup
    - Minor stability and logging improvements
-AppImage is now valid, extractable, and squashfs-correct:
    -Fixed AppDir construction to prevent creation of empty/broken AppImages.
    -Ensured AppImage contains a valid squashfs filesystem
    -Removed user-dependent GTK/GVFS paths that caused failures on clean systems.
    -Stripped unnecessary system libraries to improve portability and reduce size.
    -Confirmed AppImage launches on Ubuntu Noble and older LTS without missing module errors.
-Fixed missing Linux GTK modules:
    -Issues involving:
    -libgvfsdbus.so
    -xapp-gtk3-module
    -GVFS/GIO missing symbols have been resolved by removing bad host paths from the bundle and letting the system load its own clean modules.
-Debian package tarball fix:
    -Fixed .deb packaging failure caused by invalid gzip/tar metadata by:
    -Creating a safe bootstrap.tar.gz using validated, non-empty files.
    -Ensuring .pkgmeta directory is created before packaging.
- Testing notes:
    -App starts correctly when merge_output_format is blank or invalid.
    -"Check for yt-dlp update" downloads to temp and safely replaces the executable.
    -Bundled yt-dlp reliably detected after installation.
    -Settings dialog opens fast, no modal popup spam.
    -Linux:
        -AppImage extracts cleanly (valid squashfs)
        -DEB installs & extracts without tar/gzip errors.
